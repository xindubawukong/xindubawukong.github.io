## Research Experience

Deep Neural Network Model Compression
- This is my graduation project.
- Leader: Wenjian Yu, Associate Professor, Department of Computer Science, Tsinghua University
- Research several model compression methods (quantization, pruning, etc.) and their pros and cons. Use HLS (High Level Synthesis) to deploy compressed model to FPGA.
- Aiming to <a href="https://dac.com/content/2020-system-design-contest">DAC SDC 2020 Contest</a>.

Application of Fast Matrix SVD on Large Recommendation System, January - present.
- Belong to Tsinghua University Initiative Scientific Research Program and DCST Student Academic Training Program （清华大学学术推进计划、计算机系学术新星计划）.
- Leader: Wenjian Yu, Associate Professor, Department of Computer Science, Tsinghua University
- Designed large network recommendation algorithm based on randomized singular value decomposition. Used SVD in recommendation system based on machine learning methods.

WSI images cancer detection, April 2018 – March 2019
- Tsinghua University Students Research Training Program (SRT)
- Leader: Hailong Yao, Associate Professor, Department of Computer Science, Tsinghua University
- This project is carried out on <a href="https://iciar2018-challenge.grand-challenge.org/">ICIAR2018</a> dataset. The competition requires to classify images in four different kinds of breast cancer, and then detect cancer areas on whole slide images (WSI). Apply <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7460968">Vahadane’s algorithm</a> for data normalization. Use pytorch based models for classification. Apply <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expectation%E2%80%93maximization_algorithm">EM algorithm</a> to utilize unlabeled data. The output of this project is a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.01696">co-first author paper</a>.
