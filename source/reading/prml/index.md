I always think that my knowledge is poor on basic machine learning theory. So I decided to read the book *Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning*. This page includes my reading notes, which briefly summarize the contents of the book.. Sentences are abbreviated in my habit. It is not guaranteed that all contents of this book is included in the notes.
